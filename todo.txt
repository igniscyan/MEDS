Notes about what's left to do: 

having the queue be on the same page as the patient view is confusing and unnecessary. 

We're going to need to restore the old patients component, and then just have a separate queue page.



-Implement the new queue page
-Restore old patient page 
-Fix react-select for groups
-Implement trigger query for drug assignment.
